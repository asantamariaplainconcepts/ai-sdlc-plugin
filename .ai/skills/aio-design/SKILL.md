description: Route any UI work through the design system — read DESIGN.md, compose kit components, resolve copy through i18n, validate before pushing. Use when building or changing a screen, component, or user-facing copy.

Route UI work through the design system — one responsibility. This skill contains **no design
values**: values live in the canonical layer, so this file can never drift from it.

## Steps

1. **Read the contract.** Open `DESIGN.md` at the repository root. It carries the current token
   vocabulary and the rules. Do not proceed from memory of a previous session.
   - Done when: the tokens and rules for this change are in hand.
2. **Find the component before writing one.** Compose `src/frontend/shared/ui/kit.tsx`
   and the vendored `.pc-*` classes. If the kit lacks what a screen needs, add it to the kit.
   Use inline styles only for layout, as allowed by `DESIGN.md`.
   - Done when: every visual element the change renders maps to the kit and its tokens.
3. **Resolve copy through the catalogue.** Every user-facing string comes from
   `src/frontend/shared/i18n/`, follows the rules in `DESIGN.md#writing`, and uses the
   locked vocabulary in `README.md`.
   - Done when: no literal user-facing text exists in the change and every new key is in the
     catalogue.
4. **Cover all four states.** Any view that loads data renders empty, loading, error and success
   — each following its documented pattern.
   - Done when: all four are implemented, not just the happy path.
5. **Check both themes and keyboard focus.** Light and dark are equally first-class; every
   interactive element shows the shared focus treatment.
   - Done when: the change has been seen in both themes and tabbed through.
6. **Validate before pushing.** Run
   `aspire do ci --apphost src/root/AiOrchestrator.AppHost/AiOrchestrator.AppHost.csproj`.
   This is the local gate, not a GitHub Actions check. The legacy
   `scripts/validate-design-system.sh` entry point delegates to the same command.
   - Done when: the complete gate exits zero and the changed screens pass the visual checks above.

## If a token or component is missing

Change tokens or vendored component CSS upstream and re-import, preserving the provenance
headers in `src/frontend/styles/`. Do not use the retired token generator: `DESIGN.md` is an
authored contract, not generated output.

## Do not

- Put literal visual values in a screen or this skill; follow `DESIGN.md` for permitted layout values.
- Branch on the theme in a component — consume the variable and let the theme swap its value.
- Remove a focus outline without replacing it.
- Add a component library or a second token system.
- Edit a generated file by hand.
